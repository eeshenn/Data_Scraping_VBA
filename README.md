# Data_Scraping_VBA

This is just a simple project to show how i scrape data using VBA. The data I scraped is from this website https://data.gov.sg/dataset/bunker-sales-monthly/resource/44da3191-6c57-4d4a-8268-8e2c418d4b43/view/d8d07ae9-ab58-4ae0-84f7-7bf6e6ee93f9


# Scraping_historical_data
This code shows how i scrape the the historical data from the website initially. I also transform the format of the raw data into a more desirable format. 

# Updating_data
This code shows how i automate the scraping of updated data from the website every month.
